# Bomb-Defuser
# Timer Countdown and Defuse Game

This is a simple web application that implements a 10-second countdown timer. The timer decrements by 1 every second and displays the remaining time in an HTML paragraph element with the id "timer."

## How It Works

1. The timer starts as soon as the page loads.
2. The timer value is displayed in the HTML paragraph element with the id "timer."
3. If you enter the text "defuse" in the HTML input element with the id "defuser" and press Enter before 10 seconds, the message "You did it!" will be displayed in the "timer" paragraph element.
4. If you don't enter the text "defuse" in the "defuser" input element and don't press Enter before 10 seconds, the message "BOOM" will be displayed in the "timer" paragraph element.
